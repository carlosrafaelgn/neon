# Neon Labyrinth Maker

My son is really into labyrinth games these days (July 2019). So... I decided to make one for him! Holes became bombs because he loves explosions! Cucumbers must be collected in some levels because he enjoys a certain cucumber from a famous cartoon. üòÅ

Since I do not have much time, and also because I am not *that* good at designing levels, I created a maker-like game.

Accelerometer support is experimental. It may have an inverted behavior or may not even work at all in different devices/browsers.

The game uses Phaser 3.18.1 and it can be played here: [carlosrafaelgn.github.io/neon](https://carlosrafaelgn.github.io/neon/ "Neon Labyrinth Maker"). You can also download an [Android WebView](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=br.com.carlosrafaelgn.neon "Google Play") wrapper (just to keep the screen on without touching it).
